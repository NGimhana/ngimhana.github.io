## Graduate Research Assistant, William & Mary, USA (Sep 2022 - Present)
* <ins>Relative Comprehensibility Prediction</ins> (March 2023 - Oct 2024)
    * Introduced "relative comprehensibility (RC)" as a novel way of measuing code comprehensibility which is resistant to noise in the human-based understandability proxies.
    * Designed and implemented experiments for studying the ability of ML models to learn from code features to predict RC.
    * Work is submitted and under review.
    * Technologies & tools: Scikit-learn, Java, Python, Gradle, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Git, Latex

* <ins>Bug Localization</ins> (Sep 2022 - Feb 2023)
    * Coducted an empirical study to investigate the effectiveness of using GUI interaction data to improve text retrieval-based bug localization.
    * Constructed a dataset consists of 80 real-world android ui bug reports with their corresponding bug-fixing commits and GUI interaction data.
    * Our results illustrate that augmenting traditional techniques (eg, BugLocator, UnixCoder...) with GUI information leads to a relative increase in Hits@10 of 13-18%.
    * Work is accepted at International Conference of Software Engineering 2024 in the research track.
    * Technologies: Java, Python, Git, Latex

* <ins>Bug Report Chatbot</ins> (Sep 2022 - Feb 2023)
    * Introduced a web-based chatbot for interactive reporting of Android app bugs. 
    * It guides the users in reporting essential bug report elements, i.e., the observed behavior, expected behavior, and the steps to reproduce the bug. It verifies the quality of the text written by the user and provides instant feedback. 
    * In addition, it provides graphical suggestions that the users can choose as alternatives to textual descriptions.
    * Work is accepted at International Conference of Software Engineering 2023 in the tool demo track.
    * Technologies & tools: Android, Java, Python, React, Git, Latex
