Hello there! My name is Nadeeshan De Silva (නදීෂාන් ද සිල්වා in Sinhalese script). I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/) at College of William and Mary, where I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Oscar Chaparro](https://ojcchar.github.io/).

I broadly work on applyinig {machine, deep} learning to assist developers in software engineering tasks. My doctoral research is currently focused on improving automatic code comprehension to develop more effective developer tools and improving bug report management systems.

Before joining William and Mary I started working as a Software Engineer at [Enactor](https://www.enactor.com/), Sri Lanka. Then after 9th months I was promoted as Senior Software Engineer. I was part of multiple teams; core platform, automated testing and devops. 

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/), Sri Lanka in 2020. I completed my thesis on “Dynamic Phylogenetic Tree Construction Using LSH and K-mers” with Dr. [Indika Perera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7txwaPoAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Anuradha Wickramasinghe](https://anuradhawick.com/). As an undergraduate, I interned at [WSO2](https://wso2.com/) in Sri Lanka, where I worked on developing a proof of concept for "WSO2 Healthcare Solutions" under the guidance of Mr. [Nuwan Bandara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nuwanbando/) and Mr. [Chanaka Fernando](https://lk.linkedin.com/in/chanakaudaya/).

Outside work, I love spending time playing tennis, watching movies, nature walks, and trying out new recipes.
